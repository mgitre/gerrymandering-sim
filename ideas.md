# Ideas 

Just listing some ideas that I can use

For a general essay format:
Intro: What is gerrymandering
What's wrong with it:
* Takes away individual power in everything but close districts
* Easily manipulable/creating a *false majority*
* Can be used to disenfranchise people

What can be done about it:
Specific solutions:
* Independent redistricting commissions (how do these decide?)
* Physical restrictions on shape of districts (this cant fix everything)
* Smaller districts (cons: more representatives, more money)

Demonstrate cracking and packing
* Cracking: splitting up a group of people into multiple districts
* Packing: putting a group of people into one district
